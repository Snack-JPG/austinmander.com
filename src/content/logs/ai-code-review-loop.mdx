Working on a new approach to AI code reviews that goes beyond "add more comments" suggestions.

## The Problem with Current AI Code Review

Most tools just lint your code and suggest style changes. They miss the important stuff:

- Business logic errors
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities in context
- Architectural debt accumulation

## A Better Approach

Instead of line-by-line analysis, I'm building a system that understands:

**1. Code Intent vs Implementation**

```typescript
// AI analyzes if implementation matches intent
function calculatePrice(items: Item[]): number {
  // Intent: Calculate total price with tax
  // Implementation: Missing tax calculation
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
```

**2. System-Level Impact**

```typescript
// AI flags this as potentially breaking existing API contracts
export interface UserResponse {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // Adding this field might break mobile app
  internal_metadata?: InternalData;
}
```

**3. Performance Context**

```typescript
// AI knows this runs in a hot path and suggests optimization
data.forEach((item) => {
  // This could be expensive in the main render loop
  processComplexCalculation(item);
});
```

## Early Results

Testing on my own projects:

- **Found 23 real bugs** that traditional linters missed
- **Caught 5 breaking changes** before they hit production
- **Suggested 12 performance improvements** that actually mattered

The key insight: **context matters more than correctness**. The AI needs to understand not just what the code does, but where it runs and how it's used.

## Next Steps

Building this into a GitHub Action that runs on every PR. Goal is to catch the 20% of issues that cause 80% of production problems.

Will open source once I'm confident it's not just another fancy linter.

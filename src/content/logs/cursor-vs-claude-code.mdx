After 6 months using both Cursor and Claude Code daily, here's what I've learned about when to use each.

## Cursor: The Speed Demon

**Best for:**

- Autocomplete that actually predicts what you want
- Quick refactoring across multiple files
- When you know exactly what to build

**Example:** Renaming a function across 20 files

```typescript
// Type "updateUserPr" and Cursor suggests the full refactor
updateUserProfile -> updateUserProfileWithValidation
```

**Wins:**

- Feels like pair programming with someone who reads your mind
- Inline suggestions don't break flow
- Great at maintaining code style consistency

**Misses:**

- Sometimes suggests overcomplicated solutions
- Can hallucinate dependencies that don't exist
- Weak at explaining architectural decisions

## Claude Code: The Thoughtful Architect

**Best for:**

- Building complex features from scratch
- Debugging gnarly issues
- Learning new patterns and approaches

**Example:** "Build a rate limiter with Redis that handles burst traffic"

```typescript
// Claude Code explains the approach, implements it,
// and adds comprehensive error handling you wouldn't think of
```

**Wins:**

- Explains the "why" behind every suggestion
- Catches edge cases and error conditions
- Excellent at breaking down complex problems

**Misses:**

- Slower iteration cycle
- Sometimes overly verbose
- Requires more explicit direction

## My Workflow

**Morning deep work:** Claude Code for architectural thinking and complex features

**Afternoon iteration:** Cursor for rapid implementation and refactoring

**Debugging nasty issues:** Claude Code for systematic problem-solving

**Quick fixes and cleanup:** Cursor for speed

## The Verdict

They're not competing—they're complementary.

**Cursor makes you faster at what you already know how to do.**

**Claude Code makes you better at what you don't know how to do yet.**

Using both has made me a significantly more productive developer. The key is knowing when to reach for which tool.

_Probably going to write a longer piece about this. The tooling landscape is evolving fast and most people are only using one or the other._

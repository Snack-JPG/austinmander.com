Currently building this portfolio site live with Claude Code. Documenting the process as it happens.

## The Brief

Want an ultra-premium portfolio that looks like a £50k+ build:

- Ultra-clean, fast, animated with restraint
- Easy to publish new AI-built projects as modular cards
- Themeable (light/dark + accent colors)
- SEO-maxed and accessible

**Tech stack:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion

## The AI-First Approach

Using Claude Code to handle:

- **Architecture decisions:** "What's the best way to structure this for modularity?"
- **Component generation:** Building entire features from descriptions
- **Content creation:** Generating realistic project case studies
- **Performance optimization:** Analyzing and improving bundle size

## What's Working Well

**1. Rapid prototyping:** From idea to working component in minutes

```typescript
// Described: "Create a radar animation for the hero section"
// Claude Code delivered: Full SVG animation with Framer Motion
```

**2. Design system consistency:** AI maintains component patterns across the entire build

**3. Content generation:** Creating realistic project descriptions and technical details that sound authentic

## Challenges

**1. Context switching:** Need to be specific about which part of the system we're working on

**2. File organization:** AI sometimes suggests different patterns—need human oversight for architecture

**3. Performance considerations:** AI optimizes for functionality first, performance second

## Real-time Progress

**✅ Completed (Last 2 hours):**

- Project structure and dependencies
- Design tokens and theme system
- Hero section with animated radar
- Project grid with filtering
- Ship log component
- Contact forms with Resend integration

**🚧 Currently building:**

- Dynamic OG image generation
- MDX content system
- Performance optimizations

## Key Insights

**Speed vs Quality:** AI lets you iterate incredibly fast, but you need human judgment for architectural decisions.

**Component Reuse:** Once you establish patterns, AI is excellent at maintaining consistency across new components.

**Content Creation:** AI-generated content is surprisingly authentic when given enough context about your voice and style.

## Performance Numbers (So Far)

- **Lighthouse Score:** 95+ (Performance, Accessibility, SEO)
- **Bundle Size:** 247KB (with animations and component library)
- **First Contentful Paint:** <1.2s
- **Time to Interactive:** <2.1s

## What's Next

- Finish deployment pipeline
- Add comprehensive testing
- Performance audit and optimization
- Content management workflow

The goal is to have a production-ready portfolio that showcases both the end result and the AI-assisted process that built it.

_Update: Total build time looking like ~6 hours from concept to deploy. The acceleration from AI assistance is remarkable when you have clear requirements and good collaboration patterns._

## The Concept

Every frontend developer knows the pain: you build a new component, manually test it in a few scenarios, ship it, then discover edge cases in production. **SmokeRunner AI eliminates this cycle.**

It generates comprehensive smoke tests for your components, runs them against your localhost, and feeds failures back to an AI agent until everything passes. The fastest way to trust new code.

## How It Works

```bash
# Install and run on any component
npx smokerunner-ai ./src/components/Button.tsx

# SmokeRunner AI will:
# 1. Analyze your component's props and API
# 2. Generate Playwright tests for common scenarios
# 3. Run tests against your dev server
# 4. Fix failures by updating component or tests
# 5. Repeat until all tests pass
```

### The Testing Loop

**Step 1: Component Analysis**
SmokeRunner scans your component file to understand:

- Props interface and types
- Conditional rendering logic
- Event handlers and callbacks
- Accessibility requirements

**Step 2: Test Generation**
Based on the analysis, it generates tests for:

- Default rendering states
- All prop combinations
- Edge cases (empty strings, null values)
- User interactions (clicks, form inputs)
- Accessibility compliance

**Step 3: Self-Healing**
When tests fail, the AI agent:

- Analyzes the failure screenshot and logs
- Determines if it's a component bug or test issue
- Suggests fixes for either the component or test
- Applies fixes and re-runs the tests

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Core testing loop
const runSmokeTests = async (componentPath: string) => {
  const analysis = await analyzeComponent(componentPath);
  let tests = await generateTests(analysis);

  while (true) {
    const results = await runPlaywrightTests(tests);

    if (results.allPassed) {
      console.log("✅ All smoke tests passed!");
      break;
    }

    const fixes = await healFailures(results.failures);
    tests = await applyFixes(tests, fixes);
  }
};
```

**AI Integration Points:**

- Component analysis using Claude's code understanding
- Test case generation based on prop types and usage patterns
- Failure diagnosis through screenshot analysis
- Fix suggestion and application

## Current Progress

**✅ Completed:**

- Component parsing and prop extraction
- Basic test generation for common patterns
- Playwright integration and execution
- Failure screenshot capture

**🚧 In Development:**

- AI-powered failure analysis
- Self-healing test updates
- Complex interaction testing
- CI/CD integration

**📋 Roadmap:**

- Visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Cross-browser validation
- Team collaboration features

## Early Results

Testing on my own components:

- **95% reduction** in manual testing time
- **Found 12 edge cases** I would have missed
- **Zero production bugs** for AI-tested components
- **3-5x faster** iteration cycles

## Why This Matters

Traditional testing approaches ask developers to think like QA engineers. SmokeRunner AI flips this: **the AI thinks like a QA engineer while you focus on building**.

It's not about replacing human testing—it's about eliminating the tedious, mechanical testing that slows down development. Save human attention for the complex, creative testing that actually matters.

## Open Source Plans

Planning to open-source the core engine once the self-healing loop is stable. The goal is to make AI-assisted testing as common as syntax highlighting.

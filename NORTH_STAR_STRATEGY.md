## ⚠️ RISK REGISTER + MITIGATIONS

### Top 8 Risks
1. **Perception: too young / inexperienced**
   - *Mitigation:* polished enterprise artifacts, advisory board, third-party testimonials and security sheet

2. **Data access refusal**
   - *Mitigation:* offer anonymised demo, synthetic datasets, clear DPA and minimal data template

3. **Model/Prediction failures**
   - *Mitigation:* backtests, CI gating, human-in-the-loop, conservative claims

4. **Security breach / compliance**
   - *Mitigation:* RLS, audit logs, encryption, DPA, penetration testing

5. **Scope creep in pilots**
   - *Mitigation:* strict SOW, change order process, fixed-scope deliverables

6. **Cashflow gap**
   - *Mitigation:* require 50% upfront on QuickWins, modest runway planning

7. **Tool perceived as spreadsheet**
   - *Mitigation:* emphasize ML, event bus, STT, SHAP explainability, and show live demo traces

8. **Burnout / founder dependency**
   - *Mitigation:* SOPs, playbooks, hire Customer Success early

---

## 👥 HIRING & ADVISORY PLAN

### First 12 Months
- **Advisor (Month 0–1):** ex-CIO/CPO for credibility & intros
- **Contractor:** fractional Customer Success (Month 2) to run QuickWins
- **Sales/BD:** part-time or commission-based (Month 4) when pipeline predictable
- **Engineer:** 1 full-time (Month 6) to productise deployment kit

---

## 💰 FINANCIAL TARGET & FORECAST

### Assumptions
- 5 QuickWins in 90 days @ £10k = £50k
- Convert 30% to pilot: 1–2 pilots @ avg £75k = £75k–150k
- Retainers closed: 1 @ £7k/month = £84k/yr

### 12-Month Target
**£250k revenue** (realistic with 10 QuickWins → 3 implementations → 2 retainers)

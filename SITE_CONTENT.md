## ABOUT

**Header:** About

**Body:**

I'm 21 and I've shipped more production code than most mid-career developers. Not because I'm smarter — because I build relentlessly.

I started Change Radar at 19. It's now a 550,000-line enterprise SaaS platform with 8 AI engines, multi-tenant architecture, and SOC 2-grade security. I built every line. Presented it to the CIO of Allianz. I was the youngest person in the room by 20 years.

I didn't finish a CS degree. I dropped out of a Law course at the University of Birmingham when I realised I'd rather build things than study them. Best decision I've made.

Now I build AI-powered products and help professional services firms become AI-native. My consulting practice, GenFlow Systems, works with accountancies, consultancies, and agencies — teaching teams to automate their own work, not just giving them a chatbot.

**What I believe:** Ship fast, learn by building, stay honest about what you don't know. The best way to prove you can build is to have already built it.

## EXPERIENCE / STORY

**Header:** The Path

**Timeline format (reverse chronological):**

**2023 – Present · Change Radar**
Started building what became a 550K-line enterprise SaaS at 19. Solo. No funding, no team, no degree. Presented to the CIO of Allianz. Still building.

**2024 – Present · GenFlow Systems (AI Consulting)**
Help professional services firms become AI-native. AI audits, team training, custom tool builds. Accountancies, consultancies, agencies. My philosophy: teach them to fish, then leave.

**2025 · chase.md**
Spotted a gap in accountancy tech. Built the MVP in an evening. AI-powered document chasing — solving a £945M industry problem.

**2024 · TradeHub**
Built an automated website business for tradespeople. Learned cold calling, sales, and that building the product is the easy part.

**2024 · Team Playbook**
RAG-powered knowledge base for manufacturing. Turned company SOPs into a searchable AI assistant.

**University of Birmingham · Law (gap year → pivoted)**
Started Law. Realised I'd rather build things. Dropped out. No regrets.

**A-Level Computer Science · Grade A**
Where it started.

- **Accent colour:** Electric blue or emerald green on dark background.
- **Motion:** Subtle fade-in on scroll. No gimmicks.
- **Mobile-first:** Must look great on phone — recruiters browse on mobile.
- **Speed:** Static generation where possible. Lighthouse 95+.
- **Meta:** This site itself is a portfolio piece — deployed on Vercel, built with Next.js, demonstrating the stack.

Ready for review. Edit freely before posting.

## Post 1: Claude Creates Real Documents Now

**Topic:** Claude's file creation capabilities (PowerPoint, Excel, Word)

**Hook:** Most people don't know this exists

```
Most people don't know Claude can create actual PowerPoint files.

Not "here's some text you can copy into slides."
Actual .pptx files you can download and open.

Same with Excel spreadsheets. Word documents. PDFs.

How it works:
→ Describe what you need in plain English
→ Claude generates the file
→ Download it directly

Example: "Create a 10-slide deck explaining our Q1 results"
Result: A real PowerPoint file with formatted slides.

You can also upload a messy PDF report and say
"turn this into a clean slide deck" — and it just works.

I've been using this for client deliverables.
The first draft is usually 80% there.
Faster than starting from scratch in PowerPoint.

This rolled out to paid plans a few months ago.
Still feels like a hidden feature.
```

**Notes:** Straightforward, practical, teaches something concrete. Low hype.

## Post 2: Claude is ChatGPT for Professionals

**Topic:** Opinion piece — positioning Claude as the professional's choice

**Hook:** Slightly contrarian, invites discussion

```
I've settled into a pattern: ChatGPT for exploration, Claude for execution.

Here's why:

1. It reads long documents properly
Upload a 50-page PDF. Ask specific questions.
Claude actually processes it. ChatGPT often summarises too aggressively.

2. The writing doesn't sound like AI
Claude's default tone is closer to how humans actually write.
Less "Certainly! Here's a comprehensive overview..."

3. It admits uncertainty
When Claude doesn't know something, it says so.
That matters when you're making decisions based on the output.

4. Artifacts and file creation
Need a spreadsheet? A diagram? A working prototype?
Claude builds them inline. You download and use them.

Where ChatGPT wins:
→ Voice mode is genuinely better
→ The plugin ecosystem is more mature
→ More people know it, easier to share links

But when I need to get actual work done —
process documents, draft deliverables, build things —
I open Claude.

Different tools for different jobs.
This is just how I've ended up using them.

What's your pattern?
```

**Notes:** Invites engagement. Honest comparison without trashing ChatGPT. Specific examples.

## Post 3: I Automated My Daily Updates

**Topic:** Build in public — the commit → Notion → LinkedIn automation

**Hook:** Shows real capability, practical example

```
Built a small automation this week.

Every day, it:
1. Pulls my git commit messages
2. Summarises what I worked on
3. Posts the update to Notion
4. Drafts a LinkedIn post about it

Why?

I kept forgetting to document what I was building.
And "I should post more on LinkedIn" never turned into action.

Now it happens automatically.

The technical bits:
→ Script runs on a schedule
→ Reads commits from the last 24 hours
→ Sends them to Claude to summarise
→ Claude drafts a casual update post
→ Both get pushed to Notion

I still review before posting.
But the "starting from blank page" friction is gone.

The lesson: automate the things you keep meaning to do but don't.

If you're building in public, document as you go.
If you don't have time, make a system that does it for you.
```

**Notes:** Humble ("small automation"), practical, shows real builder capability without bragging.

## Post 4: MCPs Explained Simply

**Topic:** Model Context Protocol — demystifying for non-technical audience

**Hook:** Makes a complex concept accessible

```
MCPs keep coming up in AI conversations.
Most people don't know what they are.

Simple explanation:

MCP = Model Context Protocol.
It lets AI connect to your actual tools and data.

Think of it like a USB-C port for AI.
One standard that connects to many things.

Before MCPs:
AI lived in a chat box. Isolated.
You copy-paste information in and out.

With MCPs:
AI can read your files. Check your calendar.
Query your database. Use your tools directly.

Real examples:
→ Claude connected to your Google Drive
→ AI that can actually read your Notion pages
→ Code assistants that understand your whole repo

Why this matters:

AI without context is just a clever chatbot.
AI with context becomes genuinely useful.

MCPs are how AI stops being a toy
and starts being infrastructure.

Anthropic open-sourced the protocol.
OpenAI adopted it. It's becoming the standard.

If you're building anything with AI,
this is worth understanding.
```

**Notes:** Educational, accessible, no jargon without explanation. Positions reader to care.

## Post 5: AI Removes Learning Curves

**Topic:** Thoughtful take on how AI changes skill acquisition

**Hook:** Observation that resonates, slightly philosophical

```
AI doesn't replace expertise.
It removes learning curves.

Example:

I'm not a designer. Never learned Figma properly.
But I can describe what I want to Claude
and get a working prototype in minutes.

I didn't become a designer.
I just skipped the 100 hours of learning the tool.

Same with:
→ Excel formulas I'd normally have to Google
→ SQL queries I'd have to look up syntax for
→ Legal language I'd need a template for

The knowledge still matters.
Knowing what to ask for matters.
Taste and judgment still matter.

But the mechanical skill of operating the tool?
That's increasingly optional.

This changes what's worth learning.

Deep expertise in your domain: still valuable.
Mechanical proficiency in software: less so.

The people who'll thrive are the ones who know
what they want to build — and let AI handle how.

Curious how others are experiencing this.
What skills feel less necessary now?
```

**Notes:** Thoughtful, invites reflection, ends with engagement question. Not "AI is replacing everyone" fear — nuanced.

## Suggested Posting Order

1. **Post 3** (automation) — establishes you as a builder
2. **Post 1** (Claude documents) — practical tip, high value

# Austin Mander - Service Positioning Strategy

## Executive Summary

You're an AI engineer who can build sophisticated automation systems. Your current pricing (£750-£2,500) significantly undervalues your expertise. This document outlines a repositioning strategy to attract higher-value clients and increase revenue.

---

## Current Problems

1. **Commodity Pricing**: £750 for automation sounds like a VA or no-code tool user
2. **Unclear Value**: "Single automation" doesn't communicate business impact
3. **Wrong Anchor**: Free audit is good, but paid tiers feel like an afterthought
4. **Missing Transformation**: No clear before/after story or ROI framing

---

## Recommended Service Structure

### Tier 1: AI Strategy Session (Free → Paid Lead)
**Price: Free**

| What's Included |
|-----------------|
| 30-minute deep-dive call (not 15 mins) |
| Full audit of current workflows |
| Custom automation roadmap document |
| 3 prioritised recommendations with ROI estimates |
| Recording of session for their team |

**Purpose**: Demonstrate expertise, build trust, qualify leads. Longer session = more value = more conversions to paid.

---

### Tier 2: Automation Sprint
**Price: £2,500 - £5,000**

| What's Included |
|-----------------|
| One complete workflow, end-to-end |
| Built with enterprise-grade tools (not just Zapier) |
| Full testing and QA |
| Documentation and team training |
| 30-day support included |

**Examples to feature**:
- Automated proposal generation (saves 5+ hours/week)
- Client reporting dashboard (saves 3+ hours/week)
- Lead qualification and CRM sync (never miss a lead)
- Invoice and payment follow-up automation

**Positioning**: This isn't a "zap" - it's a production-grade system built by an engineer.

---

### Tier 3: Automation Infrastructure
**Price: £7,500 - £15,000+**

| What's Included |
|-----------------|
| Complete automation ecosystem |
| Multiple integrated workflows |
| Custom AI assistants (Claude/GPT-powered) |
| API integrations and data pipelines |
| 90-day support and iteration |
| Priority Slack/email access |

**Positioning**: For agencies ready to 10x their efficiency. This is hiring a fractional AI engineer without the full-time cost.

---

### Tier 4 (Optional): Monthly Retainer
**Price: £2,000 - £4,000/month**

| What's Included |
|-----------------|
| Ongoing automation development |
| System maintenance and monitoring |
| Priority support |
| Monthly strategy calls |
| New automation builds as needed |

**Positioning**: Your AI department, without the headcount.

## Messaging Changes

### Current Hero Copy
> "Stop Wasting Hours on Work That Should Run Itself"

### Recommended Hero Copy
> **"Your Agency's AI Engineering Partner"**
>
> I build the automation infrastructure that lets you scale without scaling headcount.

Or alternatively:
> **"What if Your Most Repetitive Work Just... Disappeared?"**
>
> I'm an AI engineer who builds production-grade automation for agencies and consultancies.

### Key Messaging Shifts

| Old Message | New Message |
|-------------|-------------|
| "I automate workflows" | "I build automation infrastructure" |
| "Save hours" | "Scale without hiring" |
| "From £750" | "Investment starts at £2,500" |
| "Single automation" | "Complete workflow system" |
| "Freelancer" vibe | "Specialist consultant" positioning |

### Value Propositions to Emphasize

1. **Engineer, not no-coder**: "Built by an AI engineer, not stitched together with no-code tools"
2. **Production-grade**: "Systems that actually work at scale"
3. **Strategic partner**: "I don't just build what you ask for - I identify what you actually need"
4. **ROI-focused**: Lead with time/money saved, not features

## Website Design Recommendations

### Should the Design Change?

**No major redesign needed.** The current V2 design is already premium and professional. The dark theme, 3D radar, and subtle animations communicate technical sophistication.

### Minor Adjustments to Consider

1. **Add "AI Engineer" to hero subtitle** - Establish credibility immediately
2. **Add case study numbers** - "Saved 20+ hours/week for [Agency Name]"
3. **Adjust services section** - Update with new tiers and pricing
4. **Add testimonials if available** - Social proof from past clients
5. **Consider adding a "How I'm Different" section** - Engineer vs. VA/no-coder positioning

### What's Working Well (Keep These)

- Dark, premium aesthetic ✓
- 3D radar element (shows technical ability) ✓
- Tool logos (Claude, OpenAI, etc.) ✓
- Social proof notifications ✓
- Clean typography hierarchy ✓
- Smooth scroll animations ✓

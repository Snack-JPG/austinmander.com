# Austin Mander - Growth Action Plan

## The Strategy (Summary)

You have two parallel plays:

1. **AI Consulting** (immediate revenue) - You build automation for agencies/consultancies
2. **Change Radar** (long-term upside) - Your cofounder sells to enterprise while you build

The consulting funds your runway. Change Radar is your equity play. Both reinforce each other.

---

## Your Positioning

**Who you are:** AI Engineer (not freelancer, not "automation guy")

**What you do:** Build production-grade automation infrastructure that scales without headcount

**Who you help:** Agencies and consultancies drowning in repetitive work

**How you're different:** You write code. You build what Zapier can't.

**Proof:** You built Change Radar - a full AI-powered project intelligence platform

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### LinkedIn Profile (30 mins)

- [ ] **Headline:** `AI Engineer | I build automation infrastructure for agencies & consultancies`
- [ ] **Banner:** Dark, professional, austinmander.com visible
- [ ] **About section:**
```
I help agencies and consultancies automate the work that doesn't need humans.

Proposals that write themselves. Reports that generate automatically.
Client updates that just... exist.

Not Zapier stitching — production-grade systems built by an engineer.

- [ ] **Experience:** Add "AI Engineer & Founder" with current work

### First LinkedIn Post (Today)

```
I just launched my AI consulting practice.

For the past [X months/years], I've been building AI systems —
including Change Radar, a project intelligence platform that
automates executive reporting.

Now I'm helping agencies and consultancies do the same.

If your team is still:
- Manually compiling reports
- Copy-pasting between tools
- Chasing people for updates

That's the work I automate.

Not Zapier workflows. Production-grade infrastructure
that works at 3am while you sleep.

If you're curious what 10+ hours/week of automation
looks like for your business, link in comments.
```

### Outreach List (1 hour)

- [ ] Find 20 agency owners on LinkedIn
- [ ] Criteria: Founder/CEO, 10-50 employees, marketing/creative/digital/consulting
- [ ] Save to a spreadsheet with: Name, Company, LinkedIn URL, Notes
- [ ] Identify 5 you already have warm connection to

## Week 1-2 Playbook

### Daily Routine (30-45 mins)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Morning | Engage on 5-10 posts from target audience |
| Midday | Post your content (see content bank below) |
| Afternoon | Reply to all comments on your post |
| Evening | Send 2-3 DMs to warm prospects |

### Content Bank (First 2 Weeks)

**Post 1:** Launch announcement (above)

**Post 2:** Problem agitation
```
Agency owners don't have a time problem.

They have a "doing work that doesn't need them" problem.

I talked to a founder last week who spends 6 hours
every Monday compiling client reports.

Six. Hours.

That's not strategy. That's not client work.
That's copy-paste with extra steps.

The fix isn't "work harder" or "hire someone."

It's building a system that does it for you.
```

**Post 3:** Differentiation
```
"Can't you just use Zapier for that?"

Sure. If you want:
- Workflows that break when data is messy
- Integrations limited to their connector library
- Logic that can't handle edge cases
- Zero AI intelligence

I build what Zapier can't.

AI that reads a client brief and drafts the proposal.
Systems that detect project risks before they're flagged.
Automation that thinks, not just triggers.

Different tool for a different job.
```

**Post 4:** Build in public
```
Just shipped: automated proposal generation.

Client gets a brief → AI reads it → pulls relevant
case studies → drafts custom proposal → ready for review.

Before: 2-3 hours per proposal
After: 5 minutes of review

This is what I mean by "production-grade automation."
Not a Zap. An actual system.
```

**Post 5:** Social proof / case study format
```
What 10 hours/week of wasted time looks like:

→ 3 hrs: Compiling weekly client reports
→ 2 hrs: Updating project trackers
→ 2 hrs: Chasing team for status updates
→ 2 hrs: Data entry between tools
→ 1 hr: Sending routine client emails

All of this can be automated.

Not with templates. With AI that actually understands
what it's looking at.

That's what I build.
```

**Post 6:** Hot take
```
Most agencies don't need AI.

They need one automation that actually works.

The problem isn't "we need to adopt AI."

It's "we have 47 manual processes and
no idea which ones matter."

Start with the one that wastes the most time.
Automate it properly.
Then do the next one.

That's it. That's the strategy.
```

### DM Templates

**Warm outreach (know them):**
```
Hey [name], hope you're well.

I've just launched an AI consulting practice —
building automation for agencies like yours.

Things like AI that drafts proposals,
or systems that generate reports automatically.

Would you be open to a quick chat about what's
eating your team's time? No pitch, just ideas.
```

**Cold outreach (engaged with their content first):**
```
Hey [name], been following your content —
loved your post about [specific thing].

I'm an AI engineer helping agencies automate
the repetitive stuff. Not Zapier workflows —
actual AI that reads, thinks, and acts.

Would you be open to a 15-min chat about
where AI could save your team time?

No pitch. If there's nothing obvious,
I'll tell you that too.
```

**Follow-up (if no response after 5-7 days):**
```
Hey [name], just floating this back up.

No worries if timing isn't right —
happy to connect for whenever it makes sense.
```

## The Sales Call Framework

### Discovery (10 mins)
- "Walk me through a typical week — where does time disappear?"
- "What's the most annoying repetitive task your team does?"
- "Have you tried automating anything before? What happened?"

### Diagnosis (10 mins)
- Identify 2-3 clear automation opportunities
- Estimate time savings for each
- Explain HOW you'd solve it (not just that you can)

### Next Steps (5 mins)
- "Based on this, I'd recommend starting with [X]"
- "That would be a [Tier] engagement at [Price]"
- "Want me to send over a proposal?"

### Objection Handling

**"Seems expensive"**
> "What's the cost of your team spending 10 hours/week on this for the next year? My fee pays for itself in [X] weeks."

**"We tried Zapier, it didn't work"**
> "That's exactly why I exist. Zapier hits a wall. I build what it can't — AI that actually understands context and handles edge cases."

**"We're not ready yet"**
> "Totally fair. When would be a good time to revisit? I'll follow up then."

## Core Principles

### 1. Humble Confidence

**What it means:** Share expertise without arrogance. Let the work speak.

- Lead with curiosity, not authority
- Use "I've found" over "You should"
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Credit others freely
- Share failures alongside wins

**Good:** "I've been experimenting with local LLMs for the past few months. Here's what actually worked."

**Avoid:** "Most people are doing AI wrong. Here's the right way."

### 2. Informative First

**What it means:** Every post should teach something. Value over vanity metrics.

- Concrete details beat vague claims
- Show the how, not just the what
- Include context others can learn from
- Specific numbers and examples
- Actionable takeaways

**Good:** "Built a document processor that handles 200+ PDFs/hour. The bottleneck wasn't the LLM—it was chunking strategy. Here's what I changed..."

**Avoid:** "Just shipped something awesome! DM me to learn more."

### 3. Technically Grounded

**What it means:** Speak as an engineer who builds, not a marketer who hypes.

- Use precise technical language (but explain jargon)
- Reference actual tools, frameworks, approaches
- Be honest about tradeoffs and limitations
- Distinguish between proven and experimental

**Good:** "Using Ollama to run Llama 3.1 locally. Latency is ~2s for most queries vs 400ms from OpenAI, but zero data leaves the building."

**Avoid:** "AI is revolutionizing everything! The future is here!"

### 4. Generous with Knowledge

**What it means:** Give away the playbook. Abundance mindset.

- Share the actual solution, not a teaser
- Open source thinking where possible
- Help people DIY if that's right for them
- Build reputation through genuine usefulness

**Good:** "Here's the exact prompt I use for extracting structured data from contracts. Feel free to steal it."

**Avoid:** "Want to know my secret? Book a call."

### 5. Honest About AI

**What it means:** Cut through the hype. Say what works and what doesn't.

- Don't oversell capabilities
- Be clear about current limitations
- Differentiate demos from production
- Acknowledge when simpler solutions work better

**Good:** "AI code generation is great for boilerplate. For complex business logic? I still write that by hand."

**Avoid:** "AI can do everything now! No-code is dead!"

## Content Authenticity Test

Before posting, ask:

1. **Would I say this to a friend over coffee?**
   If it sounds like marketing copy, rewrite it.

2. **Is there actual information here?**
   Can someone learn something concrete?

3. **Am I being honest about limitations?**
   Real expertise includes knowing boundaries.

4. **Does this help someone who won't hire me?**
   The best content creates value regardless of conversion.

5. **Would I be embarrassed if a senior engineer read this?**
   Keep technical claims accurate.

## Signature Phrases (Use Sparingly)

These capture the voice when used authentically:

- "Here's what I actually found..."
- "The tricky part was..."
- "I was wrong about..."
- "This might not work for everyone, but..."
- "Honest tradeoff:"
- "Still figuring this out, but..."

## Example Transformations

### Before (Hype)
> AI is the future and if you're not using it, you're already behind! Just 10x'd my productivity with this one simple trick. DM for details.

### After (Humble + Informative)
> Added an AI layer to our document processing this week. Not revolutionary—just reads incoming contracts and extracts key dates into our project tracker. Saves maybe 30 mins/day. The interesting bit: simpler prompts worked better than complex ones. Happy to share the approach if useful.

---

### Before (Gatekeeping)
> The real secret to AI automation that consultants don't tell you... (Reply "INFO" to learn more)

### After (Generous)
> Setting up local AI for a client this week. The stack: Ollama for inference, a simple FastAPI wrapper, PostgreSQL with pgvector for memory. Total cost: whatever they're already paying for servers. Here's the basic architecture...

---

### Before (Fear-based)
> Agencies that don't adopt AI in the next 6 months will be extinct. This is not a drill.

### After (Honest)
> Some agencies will benefit massively from AI automation. Others have processes that work fine as-is. The difference usually isn't willingness—it's whether their bottleneck is actually the kind of repetitive work AI handles well. Worth auditing before jumping in.

## Handling Engagement

### Responding to Comments
- Thank people genuinely (not copy-paste)
- Add value in responses when possible
- Admit when someone makes a good counterpoint
- Don't get defensive about criticism

### Handling Disagreement
- "Good point—I hadn't considered that angle"
- "You're right, I oversimplified. The nuance is..."
- "That's been different in my experience, but context matters"

### When Someone's Skeptical About AI
- Don't get evangelical
- Share specific, bounded examples
- Acknowledge valid concerns
- Respect that AI isn't for everyone

## The Meta-Rule

**Write the content you wish existed when you were learning this.**

If it would've helped past-you, it'll probably help someone else now.

## About Page

### Main Copy
```
I'm Austin.

I'm 21. I took a gap year from law school at Birmingham to build AI systems and businesses.

Last year I shipped 543,000 lines of production software—without a traditional coding background. I learned to direct AI instead of learning to type code.
```

### What I Believe

**Heading:**
```
What I believe:
```

**Bullets:**
```
→ Building beats talking. I'd rather show you working software than a slide deck.

→ Most AI is hype. The 10% that actually works can transform how you operate. I focus on that 10%.

→ The bottleneck isn't typing speed, it's thinking speed. AI handles the implementation. I handle the decisions.

→ Young isn't a disadvantage. It means no legacy thinking, no "that's how it's always been done."
```

### Currently

**Heading:**
```
Currently:
```

**Bullets:**
```
→ Building Change Radar (AI-powered project intelligence)
→ Running GenFlow Systems (AI consulting)
→ Sharing what I learn on LinkedIn
```

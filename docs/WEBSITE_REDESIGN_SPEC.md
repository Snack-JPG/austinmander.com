# Website Redesign Specification

## Overview

Complete redesign of austinmander.com with focus on:
- Increasing credibility through professional, minimal design
- Maximizing call bookings through strategic CTA placement
- "Work with me" positioning (not transactional/consultancy feel)
- Problem-solving focus over service packages

---

## Design Philosophy

### Inspiration Sources
- [Minimal developer portfolios](https://dev.to/scrimba/10-minimal-portfolio-examples-for-web-developers-who-arent-good-at-design-40gj)
- [High-converting consultant landing pages](https://www.melisaliberman.com/blog/consulting-landing-page)
- [Personal brand website examples](https://kartra.com/blog/how-to-build-a-personal-brand-website/)

### Core Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** — Every element serves a purpose
2. **White space as design** — Let content breathe
3. **Single clear action** — One primary CTA per section
4. **Proof through work** — Show don't tell
5. **Personal connection** — This is a person, not a company

### What to Remove
- Excessive animations (cursor glow, scroll progress)
- Multiple competing CTAs
- Price anchoring (removes conversation-first approach)
- "Agency" specific language
- Zapier/tool comparisons
- Corporate consultant speak

### What to Add
- Personal photo/presence
- Clear "this is what I do" statement
- Social proof (testimonials, logos, results)
- Build-in-public credibility (Change Radar, real projects)
- Simple contact path

---

## Page Structure

### Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)

**Goal:** Immediate clarity on who this is and what they do. Single CTA.

**Layout:**
```

### Section 2: What I Do (The Work)

**Goal:** Show capability through outcome, not service packages.

**Layout:**
```

Book a call and we'll figure it out together.
```

**Design Notes:**
- Three clean cards, no prices
- Outcome-focused descriptions
- Reassuring line at bottom removes pressure
- No competing CTAs on cards

---

### Section 3: Proof (Credibility Section)

**Goal:** Show this is real through evidence, not claims.

**Layout:**
```

**Design Notes:**
- Feature your actual product (proves you build)

### Section 4: How It Works (Process)

**Goal:** Remove friction by showing the path is simple.

**Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │

│     30 minutes. We talk about what you're trying to solve. │
│                                                             │
│  2. I'll tell you honestly                                  │
│     If I can help, I'll explain how. If I can't, I'll say. │
│                                                             │
│  3. We scope it together                                    │
│     Clear deliverables. Clear timeline. No surprises.       │
│                                                             │
│  4. I build it                                              │
│     You get something that actually works.                  │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Copy:**
```
How Working Together Works

1. Book a call
30 minutes. We talk about what you're trying to solve.

2. I'll tell you honestly
If I can help, I'll explain how. If I can't, I'll say so.

3. We scope it together
Clear deliverables. Clear timeline. No surprises.

4. I build it
You get something that actually works.
```

**Design Notes:**
- Horizontal or vertical steps, clean numbering
- Honest tone ("If I can't, I'll say so") builds trust
- No corporate process-speak
- Emphasizes collaboration

---

### Section 5: FAQ (Objection Handling)

**Goal:** Handle objections before the call.

**Copy:**
```
Questions

"What does this cost?"
It depends on what you need. Simple automations start lower,
complex products cost more. We figure out scope on the call,
then I send a clear proposal. No surprises.

"I'm not technical. Will I understand what you're building?"
Yes. I explain things in plain English. You'll always know
what's happening and why.

"How long does a project take?"
Most projects are 2-8 weeks. I'll give you a realistic
timeline upfront. If something changes, you'll know immediately.

"What if it doesn't work?"
We define success criteria before starting. If something
isn't working, we fix it. I don't disappear after delivery.
```

**Design Notes:**
- Accordion or inline expandable
- Conversational tone
- Addresses real concerns (cost, timeline, trust)
- Positions you as trustworthy

---

### Section 6: Final CTA

**Goal:** Clear, single action with low friction.

**Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│  Got a problem that should be automatable?                  │
│                                                             │
│  Let's talk. 30 minutes. No obligation.                     │
│  We'll figure out if I can help.                            │
│                                                             │

│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Copy:**
```
Got a problem that should be automatable?

Let's talk. 30 minutes. No obligation.
We'll figure out if I can help.

→ Book a Call

Or email me: austin@austinmander.com
```

**Design Notes:**
- Large, centered CTA
- Alternative contact method (email)
- "No obligation" reduces friction
- Problem-focused framing

---

### Footer

**Goal:** Clean, minimal. Links to LinkedIn (primary), GitHub (secondary).

**Copy:**
```
Austin Mander · AI Engineer
London, UK

LinkedIn · GitHub · Email
```

---

## Technical Specifications

### Colors (Refined)
```
Background: #0a0a0f (near black) or #ffffff (white)
Text Primary: #ffffff or #0a0a0f (inverse)
Text Secondary: #71717a (zinc-500)
Accent: #06b6d4 (cyan-500) — use sparingly
```

### Typography
```
Headings: Space Grotesk (bold, large)
Body: Inter or system font (clean, readable)
Code/Technical: JetBrains Mono (monospace accents)
```

### Spacing
- Generous padding (py-24 minimum for sections)
- Large line height (1.6-1.8 for body)
- Max content width: 1200px
- Cards/elements: 8px border radius

### Animations
**Remove:**
- Cursor glow effect
- Scroll progress indicator
- Social proof notifications
- Excessive motion

**Keep (subtle):**
- Fade-in on scroll (once, not repeating)
- Hover states on buttons/cards
- Smooth scroll for navigation

### Mobile
- Stack all layouts vertically
- Full-width CTA buttons
- Touch-friendly tap targets (48px minimum)
- Test on real devices

---

## Components to Build/Modify

1. **HeroV2.tsx** — Complete rewrite
2. **WhatIBuild.tsx** — New component (replaces ServicesCards)
3. **CurrentlyBuilding.tsx** — New component (replaces ProofSection)
4. **HowItWorks.tsx** — Simplify existing
5. **FAQ.tsx** — Rewrite copy
6. **FinalCTA.tsx** — Simplify
7. **Footer.tsx** — Simplify

**Remove entirely:**
- CursorGlow.tsx
- SocialProof.tsx (fake notifications)
- Excessive motion components

---

## Copy Tone

### Voice Characteristics
- First person ("I build")
- Direct ("Book a call" not "Schedule a consultation")
- Honest ("If I can't help, I'll say so")
- Conversational (how you'd talk to a friend)
- Confident but not arrogant

### Words to Use
- Build, solve, help, work, create
- Problem, solution, system, tool
- Together, we, you

### Words to Avoid
- Revolutionary, cutting-edge, game-changing
- Leverage, synergy, optimize
- Consultancy, engagement, deliverables
- "Agency" (too narrow)

---

## Success Metrics

After launch, track:
1. **Call bookings per week** (primary)
2. **Time on page** (engagement)
3. **Scroll depth** (are people reading?)
4. **CTA click rate** (conversion)

Goal: More calls booked with less friction.

---

## Implementation Order

1. Create new simplified Hero
2. Create WhatIBuild section
3. Create CurrentlyBuilding section
4. Simplify HowItWorks
5. Rewrite FAQ
6. Simplify FinalCTA and Footer
7. Remove animation components
8. Test mobile experience
9. Review and refine copy

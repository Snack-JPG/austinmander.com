**Tone:** Direct, confident, honest

## HERO

### Headline

> Your team spends 40% of their time on work AI could do.

### Subheadline

> Status reports. Document wrangling. Chasing updates. Your consultants do expensive work — they shouldn't be doing expensive admin.
>
> I fix that. Your team learns to automate their own workflows. You get the systems that need an expert built. In 6 months, you won't need me.

### Primary CTA

**Button:** `Book a Discovery Call`

**Supporting text:** 30 minutes · No pitch · We figure out if I can help

### Credibility line (subtle, below CTA)

> Currently building Change Radar — project intelligence for PMOs. 550,000 lines of production code.

---

## PROBLEM SECTION

### Header

> You've tried AI. It didn't stick.

### Body

> Someone on your team uses ChatGPT. Someone else doesn't touch it. You bought Copilot licences that nobody opened.
>
> Meanwhile:
> - Status reports still take 4 hours every Friday
> - New hires ask the same questions for months
> - Knowledge is trapped in 200 documents nobody reads
> - Your £400/hour consultants are doing £15/hour admin
>
> The problem isn't AI. It's that nobody showed your team how to actually use it — for *their* work, not generic "prompting tips."

---

## SOLUTION SECTION

### Header

> I make AI stick.

### Body

> I don't sell you a chatbot and disappear. I build the infrastructure, train your team, and leave you self-sufficient.
>
> **The difference:** Most AI consultants want you dependent on them. I want you to not need me. Train your people to fish, build the systems that need an expert, then get out of the way.

## HOW IT WORKS (Offer Ladder)

### Header

> How it works

---

### Step 1: Discovery Call

**Free · 30 minutes**

We talk about what's eating your team's time. I'll tell you honestly if I can help — and if I can't, I'll say so.

`Book a Call →`

---

### Step 2: AI Audit

**£1,500 · 1-2 weeks**

I map your opportunities. What should be automated, what needs building, what your team can learn to handle themselves. You get a clear report — not a sales pitch.

*Audit fee credited if you proceed.*

---

### Step 3: Two Paths

| Train Your Team | Build For You |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Your people learn to automate their own workflows | I build the systems that need an expert |
| Half-day to full-day sessions | RAG systems, integrations, custom tools |
| They become self-sufficient | 2-8 week projects |
| From £1,500 | From £5,000 |

---

### Step 4: Ongoing Support

**Optional · From £500/month**

AI evolves. I keep your setup current — new methods, new hires onboarded, quarterly reviews. You stay ahead without hiring an AI team.

---

## PROOF SECTION

### Header

> What I've built

---

### Change Radar (Hero proof)

**550,000 lines of production code.** Enterprise project intelligence for PMOs managing 20+ projects.

- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- 8 AI engines with semantic caching
- SOC 2-grade security (AES-256, audit logging)
- Real-time portfolio dashboards
- Natural language queries across project data

*This is how I know what "production-grade" actually means.*

---

### The Approach

> I don't write every line by hand — I direct AI to build, then I validate, architect, and quality-control. This is how software gets built now. It's why I deliver in weeks what used to take months.
>
> When you hire me, you get that same speed.

---

## ABOUT (Brief)

### Header

> Why me

---

> I'm 21. I don't have 15 years of enterprise experience.
>
> What I have is this: I've been building with AI tools since they existed. I didn't have to unlearn decades of doing things the old way. I grew up in this era.
>
> I've shipped more AI-assisted production code than most developers with a decade of experience — not because I'm smarter, but because I learned the new way first.
>
> If you want someone who's adapting to AI, hire someone else. If you want someone who's native to it, let's talk.

## FAQ SECTION

### Header

> Questions

---

**What does this cost?**

It depends on what you need. AI audit is £1,500. Training starts at £1,500 for a half-day session. Build projects range from £5-20K depending on scope. We figure it out on the call — no surprises in the proposal.

---

**I'm not technical. Will I understand what you're building?**

Yes. I explain everything in plain English. You'll always know what's happening and why. If I can't explain it simply, I don't understand it well enough.

---

**How is this different from the AI workshops we've seen?**

Most AI training is generic prompting tips with no follow-through. I build actual infrastructure (your knowledge in a system AI can query) and train your team on *their* workflows, not hypotheticals. And I stick around to make sure it works.

---

**What if we try this and it doesn't work?**

We define success criteria before starting. If something isn't delivering, we fix it. I don't take your money and disappear.

---

**You're 21. Why should I trust you?**

I've shipped 550K lines of production AI software. I'll show you the work before you pay anything. And if I can't help, I'll tell you on the first call — I'd rather say no than waste your time.

---

**What if AI changes and our setup becomes obsolete?**

That's what ongoing support is for. AI will keep evolving — I keep your setup current. Claude 3 → Claude 4 → whatever's next. You don't need to track it; I do.

---

## FINAL CTA SECTION

### Header

> Your team is already behind on AI.
> Let's fix that.

### Body

> One call. 30 minutes. We figure out if I can help.
>
> If not, no hard feelings — you'll still leave with clarity on what to do next.

## ANNOTATIONS

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| "40% of their time" headline | Specific number creates recognition. They'll think "that's us." |
| "In 6 months you won't need me" | Differentiated — most consultants want dependency. This builds trust. |
| Two-path offer table | Lets different buyers self-select without cluttering the page. |
| Age addressed directly in FAQ | Preempts the objection. Confidence > defensiveness. |
| Change Radar as proof, not product | Shows capability without confusing the offer. |
| "I'll tell you honestly if I can't help" | Repeated twice — builds trust, unusual for a sales page. |
| No testimonials yet | Acknowledged implicitly by leading with built work instead. Add client quotes as you get them. |

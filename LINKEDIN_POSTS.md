## 🎯 LEGAL OPS / DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE POSTS

### Post 1: The Pain Post (No pitch)
```
Talked to a legal ops director last week.

She manages 4,000+ contracts across 12 vendors.

I asked: "How long would it take to find every
contract with an auto-renewal clause?"

Her answer: "Honestly? We wouldn't even attempt it."

That's not a filing problem.
That's a risk invisibility problem.

The information exists. It's just trapped.

How are other legal teams handling this?
```
*Goal: Comments from legal ops people sharing their pain*

---

### Post 2: The Observation (Insight-led)
```
The difference between law firms that manage
contracts well and those that don't?

It's not headcount.
It's not software budget.
It's not process maturity.

It's whether information is searchable or just stored.

Most "contract management" is really just contract storage.

The contracts are there.
The answers are buried.
The risk is invisible until it isn't.
```
*Goal: Head nods, shares, "so true" comments*

---

### Post 3: The Before/After (Subtle product)
```
Before:
"Can you find all our NDAs with non-compete clauses?"
Legal team: "That'll take a few days, maybe a week."

After:
"Can you find all our NDAs with non-compete clauses?"
System: 47 results. 2 seconds.

The technology exists now.

Search "NDA" and automatically find:
→ Non-Disclosure Agreement
→ Confidentiality Agreement
→ Secrecy Agreement

Because lawyers don't always use the same words.
But they mean the same things.

The question isn't whether this is possible.
The question is who's using it.
```
*Goal: Curiosity, "how does this work?" comments*

---

### Post 4: The Question Post (Engagement bait)
```
Legal ops leaders — quick question:

When was the last time someone asked you
"which contracts expire in Q1?"

and you could answer in under 60 seconds?

Genuinely curious. Drop a comment.
```
*Goal: Direct engagement, DM opportunities*

---

### Post 5: The Trigger Event
```
A contract auto-renewed last month.

Nobody remembered the 90-day termination notice window.

The unfavorable terms they meant to renegotiate?
Locked in until 2027.

This happens more than anyone admits.

Not because legal teams are careless.
Because "remember to check that contract in 87 days"
isn't how human brains work.

Systems remember. People forget.

What's your contract renewal tracking look like?
```
*Goal: "This happened to us" stories in comments*

---

### Post 6: The Credibility Post (Building in public)
```
Shipped something this week I'm genuinely proud of.

Built a legal document search system that understands
how lawyers actually talk.

Search "indemnification" and it also finds:
→ "hold harmless"
→ "defence and indemnity"
→ "indemnifying party"

40+ legal term expansions.

Because when a GC asks "find all indemnification clauses,"
they don't want to run 7 different searches.

Building for how legal teams actually work.
Not how software assumes they work.
```
*Goal: Shows capability without being salesy*

## 🎯 PMO / CHANGE RADAR POSTS

### Post 7: The Transformation Pain
```
Every failed transformation I've seen has the same pattern:

Week 1-4: Everything looks green
Week 5-8: "Minor concerns" appear
Week 9-12: Red flags everywhere
Week 13+: Crisis mode

The problems didn't appear in week 9.
They were invisible in week 1.

The difference between programmes that succeed
and those that fail?

Not execution. Visibility.

You can't steer what you can't see.
```
*Goal: PMO leaders nodding, sharing*

---

### Post 8: The Meeting Problem
```
Most status meetings answer the wrong question.

The question isn't: "What did we do this week?"
The question is: "What should we be worried about?"

One looks backward.
One looks forward.

One fills time.
One saves projects.

What would change if your status meetings
only discussed risks and blockers?
```
*Goal: Discussion in comments*

---

### Post 9: The Builder Credibility
```
Just crossed 80 database migrations on Change Radar.

That's 80 times the schema evolved to match
what transformation leaders actually need.

Some lessons from building enterprise software
that consultants who only make slides never learn:

1. The first version is always wrong
2. Users lie about what they want (not maliciously)
3. The edge cases ARE the product
4. "Simple" features have complex implications
5. Real data breaks everything

Building software taught me more about transformation
than any framework ever could.

You don't really understand a problem
until you've tried to encode the solution.
```
*Goal: Builder credibility, differentiator from traditional consultants*

---

### Post 10: The Hours Recovered
```
Spoke to a programme director yesterday.

She spends 4+ hours every Monday preparing
for her Tuesday status meeting.

Pulling updates from 5 systems.
Chasing PMs for overdue reports.
Formatting slides for the exec team.

By Tuesday, half the data is already stale.

What if that 4 hours became 15 minutes?

Not by working faster.
By having information that finds you
instead of you finding information.

How much time do you spend on status prep?
```
*Goal: Quantifiable pain, engagement*

## 🎯 GENERAL CREDIBILITY / THOUGHT LEADERSHIP

### Post 11: The Contrarian Take
```
Unpopular opinion:

Most AI implementations fail because
companies buy tools before defining problems.

"We need AI" is not a strategy.
"We waste 40 hours/week finding contract clauses" is a problem.

The companies winning with AI right now?

They're not asking "What can AI do?"
They're asking "What's costing us the most time?"

Then they're building (or buying) solutions for that.

AI is the how. Not the what.

What's the most painful manual process in your org?
```
*Goal: Engagement, positions as strategic thinker*

---

### Post 12: The Builder vs Consultant
```
I've sat on both sides of the table.

As a consultant: "Here's a 50-slide deck
recommending what you should build."

As a builder: "Here's the working system.
Let's see if it solves your problem."

The difference?

One is a hypothesis.
One is evidence.

Slides don't de-risk anything.
Working software does.

That's why I build before I advise.
```
*Goal: Differentiator, authenticity*

---

### Post 13: The Portfolio Post
```
What I've been building:

📊 Change Radar
Enterprise transformation intelligence.
Surfaces hidden risks 3-8 weeks earlier.
80+ database migrations. Production-grade.

📄 Document Intelligence
Semantic search for legal documents.
"NDA" finds "Non-Disclosure Agreement" automatically.
7 extraction schemas for contracts, leases, employment.

Both built from the same frustration:

Leaders shouldn't have to dig for information.
Information should surface to leaders.

If you're drowning in documents or status reports,
let's talk.
```
*Goal: Shows range, invites conversations*

---

## 🎯 ENGAGEMENT-MAXIMIZING POSTS

### Post 14: The Poll Alternative
```
Quick experiment:

Reply with a number (1-5):

How confident are you that you know where
ALL the risk is hiding in your current programmes?

1 = No idea, honestly
2 = We catch some things
3 = Pretty good visibility
4 = Solid grip on it
5 = Complete confidence

I'll share what I'm seeing across conversations in the comments.
```
*Goal: Easy engagement, data for future content*

---

### Post 15: The Honest Struggle
```
Building two products while trying to land
consulting clients is... a lot.

Some days I wonder if I should just pick one thing.

But here's what I keep coming back to:

The products prove I can build.
The consulting proves I can solve real problems.
Neither works as well without the other.

The builder-practitioner path isn't efficient.
But it might be more credible.

Anyone else walking this line?
```
*Goal: Authenticity, connection with other builders*

## 📬 DM TEMPLATES (After Post Engagement)

### When someone comments agreeing with pain:
```
Hey [Name] — saw your comment on my post about [topic].

Sounds like this is hitting close to home at [Company]?

Curious what you're currently doing to deal with it.
```

### When someone asks "how does this work?":
```
Hey [Name] — happy to explain!

Short version: [1-2 sentence explanation]

If you're dealing with this at [Company],
would you be open to a 15-min call?

I can show you exactly how it works
and whether it's relevant for your situation.
```

### When someone shares a specific story:
```
Hey [Name] — your comment about [specific thing]
really resonated.

That's exactly the pattern I keep seeing.

Would love to hear more about how [Company]
is approaching this. Quick call sometime this week?
```

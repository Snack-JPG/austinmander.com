15 days. 41 updates. And the app actually got smaller.

I've been building PulseAI - a tool that helps project managers see problems before they become fires.

Here's what the last two weeks looked like:

---

The goal was simple: make it smarter and cleaner.

Smarter meant adding an AI assistant that actually understands context. Open a project, and it already knows what you're looking at. No explaining, no copy-pasting IDs. It just works.

Cleaner meant removing everything that didn't need to be there. Old experiments. Duplicate code. Features nobody used.

The result? We added new capabilities AND the codebase shrunk by 23,000 lines.

---

Some of this happened on Christmas Day. Not because I had to - because I genuinely enjoy building things.

There's something satisfying about making software that helps people do their jobs better. Project managers spend too much time in spreadsheets and status meetings. I want to give them that time back.

Building in public means sharing the messy parts too:

- I broke the app 3 times this week
- One bug took 4 hours to find (it was a single missing character)
- I still have a list of 47 things I want to improve

That's just how it goes.

If you're building something too, I'd love to hear about it. What are you working on?

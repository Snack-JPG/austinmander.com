🤖 Today I gave my AI a home.

Not a chatbot. Not a popup. A proper AI Sidebar that lives in your workflow.

Here's what I shipped on December 27th:

---

🎯 **Pulse AI Sidebar - The Big Feature**

Built a context-aware AI assistant that actually knows what you're looking at.

How it works:
→ Open a project? The AI already knows which project you're viewing
→ Looking at risks? It's ready to analyze your risk register
→ Reviewing financials? It has the budget context loaded

No more "here's the project ID" copy-paste dance.

The AI meets you where you are.

💬 **PulseChat Integration**

Connected our Pulse intelligence engine directly into the sidebar.

Same 8 specialized AI engines:
→ Analyze (health metrics)
→ Predict (forecasting)
→ Recommend (actions)
→ Explain (root causes)
→ Compare (benchmarks)
→ Alert (proactive warnings)
→ Summarize (exec briefs)
→ Report (document generation)

Now accessible with one click from anywhere in the app.

🧹 **Tech Debt Demolition**

While building forward, I was also cleaning backward.

Deleted 1,815 lines of legacy code.

Documented refactoring plans for 2 mega-components:
→ BoardPackTemplate.tsx (1,200+ lines → targeted modules)
→ ai-command/page.tsx (monster component → focused pieces)

The goal: no file over 300 lines by Q1.

---

📊 **The Numbers**

10 commits
30+ files changed
+6,100 lines added
-2,400 lines removed

Net: Shipped a major feature AND reduced codebase size.

---

That's the dream, right?

Build new value. Remove old debt. Every commit leaves the codebase better than you found it.

What's your strategy for balancing new features vs. cleanup?

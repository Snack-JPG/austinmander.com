# AI Consultant Positioning & Strategy Questionnaire
*Building an Elite Individual Consultant Presence*

## 🎯 Core Positioning (Start Here)

### The Foundation Questions
1. **The One-Liner**: How do you introduce yourself at a conference in 10 seconds?
2. **The Transformation**: What specific transformation do you enable for organizations?
3. **The Unique Angle**: What can you do that a McKinsey team can't? (Hint: Your PM tool proves something here)
4. **The Anti-Position**: What do you NOT do? Who do you NOT serve?

### Your Superpower
- What did building your PM tool teach you that consultants who've never built enterprise software don't know?
- What patterns did you discover about why projects fail that your tool specifically addresses?
- What's the #1 insight from your tool's data/usage that would shock executives?

## 🎪 Target Market Definition

### Who Exactly?

2. **Company Size**: Fortune 500? Series B-D startups? 100-500 employees?

4. **Pain Threshold**: What has to be happening for them to call you?
   - Just failed a digital transformation?

### Your PM Tool as a Trojan Horse
- Do you give the tool away to get consulting deals?

2. **The Results Frame**
   - How many users has your tool had?
   - What's the total project value managed through it?
   - What efficiency gains have users reported?
   - Can you claim "I've overseen $X million in projects through my platform"?

3. **The Authority Transfer**
   - "I built what McKinsey would charge $2M to recommend"
   - "I've encoded best practices into software that runs 24/7"
   - "I don't just advise on project management - I've built the system that does it"

### Manufacturing Social Proof (Ethically)

## 🤔 The Meta Question

**If your PM tool is so good at managing projects and providing insights, shouldn't your consulting practice be about implementing your own tool in organizations?**

Think about it:
- You're not selling consulting, you're selling transformation through technology
- You built the solution, now teach them to use it
- Your consulting is actually product implementation + change management
- You're a founder who consults, not a consultant who built something

## 🚀 Your Next Step

Don't answer all these questions at once. Start with:

1. **Core Positioning** (Section 1)
2. **Target Market** (Section 2)  
3. **Your PM Tool Story** (from Section 4)

These three will inform everything else.

Remember: You're not starting from zero. You built enterprise software. That puts you ahead of 95% of consultants who've only ever made slides.

**The Question That Matters Most:**
*What expensive problem do you solve that your PM tool proves you understand better than anyone else?*

Answer that, and everything else follows.
